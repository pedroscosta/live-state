## What is Live State?

Live State is a real‑time sync engine with a strongly‑typed schema, a simple server API, and a built‑in client store for React. It lets you:

- Keep client UI in sync with the backend via WebSocket subscriptions
- Mutate data optimistically with automatic conflict resolution
- Define your domain using a type‑safe schema that maps to storage
- Build routes with authorization hooks and custom mutations

At a glance, you define a schema, mount the server adapter, and use the generated client to query and mutate data in real‑time from your app.

## Key concepts

- Schema: Declarative model of your domain (entities, fields, relations)
- Router & Routes: Server-side request handling and authorization
- Storage: Pluggable persistence (SQL storage included)
- Client: Generated query/mutation API + live subscription store
- React Utils: `SubscriptionProvider` and `useLiveQuery` for seamless UI updates

## Why Live State?

Traditional client/server data flows require a lot of glue: data fetching, cache management, websockets, optimistic updates, and conflict resolution. Live State unifies these concerns with a single developer experience and a consistent, typed protocol from server to client.
