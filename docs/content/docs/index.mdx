Live State is a data framework that provides real-time synchronization with a strongly-typed schema, a simple server API, and a built-in client store for React. It lets you:

- Keep client UI in sync with data changes
- Mutate data optimistically with automatic conflict resolution
- Define your data model using a type-safe schema that maps to storage
- Build custom server procedures with input validation and output type inference

In a nutshell, you define a schema, mount the server adapter, and use the generated client to query and mutate data in real-time.

## Key concepts

### Schema

A schema is a declarative model of your domain (entities, fields, relations). It's the foundation of your data model.

### Client

Live State's client provides a type safe query/mutation API and a global state store for React. All the data you need will be available in the client store, resolving any queries in sub-milliseconds times and reacting to data changes in real-time.

### Server

Live State's server is a custom server adapter that mounts the Live State schema and provides a RPC-like API for querying and mutating data.
